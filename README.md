# Fire!

Fire is a very simple utility mod that will send coordinates in chat when you fall into lava.

By default it will wait for 2 seconds until it sends a message and will send it in chat for everyone to see. There is also a 60s cooldown between each message

The settings can be configured either in the config file or using modmenu.

## Requirements

- Fabric
- Cloth Config
